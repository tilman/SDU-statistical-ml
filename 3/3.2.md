## 3.2.3

In the first dendrogram we can see that the clusters are not very accurate. Some 2s are clustered with 1s before the other 2s and we have the same situation with a 3 and 5s. This shows that there can be a lot of differences between two instances of the same digit when it's handwritten.

In the second dendrogram we do not have these kinds of errors, all the clusters of digits are clustered with the other clusters corresponding to their digit. The first step of clustering the instances of a same digit into five clusters allows us to get a first smoothing step on the data and the dendrogram is then able to separate correctly the digits.

Just as in the first exercise we notice that the accuracy increases when we have pre-clustered data with K-means.
