## 3.1.1 
# small disjunct train/test split with only 2 persons each

Try to improve the performance of two persons training data ( disjunct ). Perform K- means
clustering of each cipher individually for the training set, in order to represent the training data
as a number of cluster centroids. Now perform the training of the k-NN using the centroids of
these clusters. You can try with different cluster sizes and see the resulting performance.
