On the chart we can see the accuracy on one axis and the value of K on the other axis. We only choose uneven numbers for K to avoid a decission conflict. As we can see the accuracy decreases while increasing the value of K. This makes sense because we only have numbers from one person and they all look quite similar. Therefore we do not need a good generalisation for this dataset and a sharp decision boundary (small value of K) will give us the best results.
