# 1.4 Performing K-nearest neighbor ( Report 1 )
## 1.4.1 K-Nearest Neighbour:
Using the methods learned in the Chapter 3 in “Machine Learning With R”, KNN can now be performed on our own generated dataset. 
First we will test on a single person. 
Remember to split between training and test set (split in two equally sized parts).

### Document the results:
First we load the dataset id100. It contains only the data from one person, all datapoints are ordered after the number so it's really important to shuffle the dataset first, before cutting the test and train split out of it.
````R
load("~/Downloads/id100.rda")
dataset_shuffle <- id[sample(nrow(id)),]
test_split <- dataset_shuffle[0:2000,-1]
train_split <- dataset_shuffle[2001:4000,-1]
test_classes <- dataset_shuffle[0:2000,1]
train_classes <- dataset_shuffle[2001:4000,1]
````
* Can you explain the performance (computation time and test accuracy) on the training and test-set?

````R
test_classes <- id_test[0:2000,1]
train_classes <- id_train[0:2000,1]
````
