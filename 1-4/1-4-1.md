# 1.4 Performing K-nearest neighbor ( Report 1 )
## 1.4.1 K-Nearest Neighbour:
Using the methods learned in the Chapter 3 in “Machine Learning With R”, KNN can now be performed on our own generated dataset. 
First we will test on a single person. Remember to split between training and test set (split in two equally sized parts).

* Document the results:
* Can you explain the performance (computation time and test accuracy) on the training and test-set?
